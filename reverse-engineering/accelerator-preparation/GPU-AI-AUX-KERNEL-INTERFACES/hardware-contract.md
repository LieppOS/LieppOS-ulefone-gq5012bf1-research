# Hardware contract — GPU-AI-AUX-KERNEL-INTERFACES

GPUEB and VCP are the unfinished GPU/video host clients. SCP sensor/audio/CHRE host is already reconstructed; ADSP source is closed but the board has no instantiated ADSP DT node. MCUPM/SSPM are CPU/system-power dependencies, not silently bundled as GPU firmware projects. SAP/CPUEB capability names are not proof of instantiated processors.

**Evidence:** [dt-nodes.tsv](dt-nodes.tsv) is decoded from `workspace/phase4-connfem-hardware/offline-dt/gq5012bf1-merged.dtb` (stock selected base+overlay). Each row retains all properties, exact parent-bus reg ranges, interrupt cells and resolved provider arguments. [dt-providers.tsv](dt-providers.tsv) resolves clock/power/IOMMU/mailbox/reset phandles where declared. Addresses are parent-bus addresses; verify `ranges` translations before calling them physical CPU addresses. Numeric IRQ cells are DT specs, not observed Linux IRQ numbers.

GPUEB shared-memory/mailbox/11 IPI channel setup and GPU-frequency consumer callbacks; VCP/status readiness, feature reference counts, reserved/shared memory, IPI/mailboxes, loader/boot, suspend, reset and recovery. SCP/ADSP contracts are reused, not reconstructed. Each channel has distinct client-visible payload and ownership; no single universal co-processor protocol is inferred. See processors.tsv and existing tinysys protocol ledgers.

**UNKNOWN:** missing register names, IRQ servicing semantics, electrical enablement, execution or throughput not evidenced by these static rows. `okay` and module loading never establish successful probe or execution. Runtime libraries only establish consumers/capability.
